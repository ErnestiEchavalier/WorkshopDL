Since most of the popular workshop downloading websites have shutdown or instruct users to download & use SteamCMD, a command-line program,
I've decided to make my own standalone workshop downloader with a GUI to make things easier.

WorkshopDL - A Steam Workshop Downloader

# How To Use:

1. Execute "WorkshopDL.exe"
Do *not* open the "steamcmd.exe" located inside the steamcmd folder.

2. At the "Workshop Homepage" box simply copy & paste, inside the box, the game's workshop homepage URL.
For example, here is a workshop homepage "https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/".

4. At the "Workshop mod URL" box simply copy & paste, inside the box, the URL of the mod you want to download.

5. Click download.
(Note: The first time it might take longer to download cause SteamCMD is downloading some necessary files.
This will *only* happen on your very first launch.)

6. After the download is completed the folder containing the mod will open on a separate window.
7. Installation of mods differs from game to game.

Note 1: Games that aren't listed here "https://steamdb.info/sub/17906/apps/" are not guaranteed to work.

Note 2: If a game does not work, try to download the mods using the AppID (Homepage) of it's dedicated server.


# How To Use Your Own Steam Account To Download Mods:

1. Click on "Options>Setup your Steam account for downloads (Optional)".

2. Enter your Steam username on the first box and your password on the 2nd one.
(Note: If you use Steam Guard you will be asked to enter the Steam Guard Code on the SteamCMD popup.)

3. Disable the "Anon Mode" "Options>Anon Mode (Disable to use your Steam account)".

4. You can always switch between Anonymous, ("Anon Mode"), or your steam account by toggling "Anon Mode".


# How To Remove Your Own Steam Account from WorkshopDL:

1. Click on "Options>Remove your Steam account".

[OR]

1. Click on "Options>Reset Config". This will delete all settings you made in WorkshopDL including your saved account.

Note: You might also want to delete the SteamCMD folder, to remove any saved information from there too.
