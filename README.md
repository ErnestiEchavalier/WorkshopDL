<em>Since most of the popular workshop downloading websites have shutdown or instruct users to download & use SteamCMD, a command-line program,
I've decided to make my own standalone workshop downloader with a GUI to make things easier.</em>

# What is WorkshopDL?
Do you own a game on a different platform than Steam (Like GOG or the Epic Games Store) and you always wanted to use mods from the Steam workshop? WorkshopDL allows you to download mods from the Steam workshop for free! It currently supports more than 900+ games!

## Features
* User-friendly GUI.
* Very easy to use.
* You can download workshop collections!
* You can download both anonymously or using your personal Steam account (Optional).
* You can Import URLs from a text file.
* You can save your mod queue as a text file.
* Auto-URL detection and Auto-Queueing
* It offers multiple ways to download mods. SteamCMD, SteamWebAPI... and more to come!

## How To Use:
`(You can read more information for various issues, inside WorkshopDL by going at "Help>Support".)`

1. Execute "WorkshopDL.exe"
Do *not* open the "steamcmd.exe" located inside the steamcmd folder.

2. At the "Workshop Homepage" box simply copy & paste, inside the box, the game's workshop homepage URL.
For example, here is a workshop homepage "https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/".

3. At the "Workshop mod URL" box simply copy & paste, inside the box, the URL of the mod you want to download.

4. Click download.
(Note: The first time it might take longer to download cause SteamCMD is downloading some necessary files.
This will *only* happen on your very first launch.)

5. After the download is completed the folder containing the mod will open on a separate window.
6. Installation of mods differs from game to game.

Note 1: Games that aren't listed here "https://steamdb.info/sub/17906/apps/" are not guaranteed to work.

Note 2: If a game does not work, try to download the mods using the AppID (Homepage) of it's dedicated server.
