Version 1.8.5
[*] Fixed a bug that kept changing the download provider to SteamWebAPI
when selecting the Nether API.
[*] When clicking the "Download providers:" text while having Nether selected,
it will display the supported games and update them dynamically.
[*] When downloading using the Nether API, it will check if the game is supported or not
and will inform you as opposed to the previous version where it did nothing.
