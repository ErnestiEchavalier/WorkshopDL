Version 1.6.3
[*] Changed the "Transfer Downloaded Files" option to a "Mod Installer" that works. Thanks @dtoxic47 for suggesting it. 
[*] Changed it's UI to mitigate errors.

Note: When using the mod installer, if there are raw files with the same name inside, they might get overwritten.  
This is very unlikely but can happen with some garbage and lazily done Garry's mod mods.
