Version 1.6.1
[*] Added a Garry's Mod mod unpacker. (You must unpack the mods in order to use them in-game. Now you can do that within WorkshopDL)

How to use the Garry's Mod mod unpacker:
1. Select the folder where you have installed Garry's Mod.
2. Select the .gma mod you want to unpack.
3. Click unpack and you are done!

You can find the unpacked mod, at the location of the original mod before unpacking it.
